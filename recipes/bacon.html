            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>
                This is the way to get crisp bacon without having to constantly turn it, watch over it, or get burnt by splatters of grease. 
                It 'fries' up flat and doesn't curl, which looks great beside a breakfast plate of eggs, and makes BLT sandwiches much easier. 
                Very nice when feeding a family or crowd.
